## Introduction

Building your own portfolio website is a great way to showcase your skills and projects to the world. But once you've crafted the perfect site, you need to get it online. In this article, I'll guide you through the process of deploying your portfolio on GitHub Pagesâ€”a simple and free hosting solution that's perfect for static websites.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into deployment, make sure you have the following:

- **GitHub Account**: If you don't have one, sign up for a free account at [GitHub](https://github.com/).

- **Portfolio Website**: Your website should be ready and available in a local directory.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Log in to GitHub**: Open your web browser and log in to your GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Repository**: Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner of the GitHub dashboard and select "New Repository."

3. **Configure Repository Settings**:
   - Choose a unique repository name (e.g., "yourname.github.io," replacing "yourname" with your GitHub username).
   - Select "Public" so that your website is accessible to everyone.
   - Choose an appropriate license (e.g., MIT License).

4. **Create Repository**: Click the "Create repository" button to create your new repository.

## Step 2: Upload Your Website

1. **Clone Your Repository**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your portfolio website is located. Use the following command to clone your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/yourname.github.io
   ```

   Replace "yourname" with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Copy Your Website Files**: Move all your website files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) into the cloned repository directory.

3. **Commit and Push**: In your terminal, navigate to the repository folder and use the following commands to commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial website upload"
   git push origin master
   ```

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Access Repository Settings**: In your GitHub repository, click on the "Settings" tab.

2. **Scroll Down to GitHub Pages**: Under the "GitHub Pages" section, you'll find options to configure your GitHub Pages settings.

3. **Source Branch**: Choose the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages. In most cases, "master" is the default branch.

4. **Save**: After selecting the branch, click the "Save" button. GitHub Pages will now publish your website.

5. **View Your Website**: You'll see a link to your live website under the "GitHub Pages" section. It should be something like `https://yourname.github.io/`. You can access your portfolio at this URL.

## Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain (e.g., www.yourname.com), follow these additional steps:

1. **Buy a Domain**: Purchase a domain name from a domain registrar like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/).

2. **Configure DNS Records**: In your domain registrar's settings, configure DNS records to point to GitHub Pages. This typically involves creating a CNAME record with your custom domain as the value (e.g., `www`), and pointing it to `yourname.github.io`.

3. **GitHub Repository Settings**: In your GitHub repository's settings, scroll down to the "Custom domain" section, enter your custom domain (e.g., `www.yourname.com`), and click "Save."

4. **Update DNS Settings**: Back in your domain registrar's settings, ensure your domain is set to use custom DNS records. This will vary by registrar, so follow their instructions.

5. **Wait for DNS Propagation**: DNS changes can take some time to propagate across the internet. Be patient; it may take a few hours to a day for your custom domain to start working.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your portfolio website on GitHub Pages. Now, your work is accessible to the world. Whether you're a designer, developer, or any other creative professional, having an online portfolio is a fantastic way to showcase your skills and attract potential clients or employers. Keep your portfolio updated with your latest projects, and enjoy sharing your work with the world!
